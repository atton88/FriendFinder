# code snippets

Play game code is not much when most of the functionality is in the constructor objects
```
function playGame() {
    console.log("----------------------------\n");
    inquirer.prompt([{
        type: "input",
        message: "Guess a letter!",
        name: "guess",
        validate: function(guess) {
            if (guess.length === 1 && isNaN(parseFloat(guess))){
                return !lettersGuessed.includes(guess.toUpperCase());
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }]). then (function(answer) {
        var guess = answer.guess.toUpperCase();
        lettersGuessed.push(guess);
        poke.guessLetter(guess);
        console.log("\n" + poke.toString() + "\n");
        if (poke.isSolved()){
            console.log("YOU WIN!");
            console.log("Next Game");
            startGame();
        } else {
            playGame();
        }
    })
}
